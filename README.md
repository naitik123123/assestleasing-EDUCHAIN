# Asset Leasing Smart Contract

## Project Title
Asset Leasing Smart Contract

## Project Description
This project implements a decentralized smart contract for leasing assets, written in Solidity. The contract allows asset owners to register assets, set leasing prices, and manage leases. It enables potential lessees to lease assets for specified durations, ensuring secure transactions on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a transparent, secure, and decentralized platform for asset leasing, eliminating the need for intermediaries while providing a seamless experience for asset owners and lessees.

## Key Features
- **Asset Registration:** Owners can register assets with unique IDs, names, and leasing prices.
- **Lease Management:** Users can lease available assets for specific durations by paying the required amount in Ether.
- **Secure Payments:** Ensures payments are directly handled through the contract.
- **Lease Termination:** Allows owners or lessees to end active leases.
- **Ownership Control:** Only the owner of the contract can add assets and withdraw funds.

## Future Scope
- **Advanced Features:** Add penalty mechanisms for overdue leases.
- **ERC20 Support:** Integrate token-based payments for broader usability.
- **Asset Reviews:** Enable lessees to leave feedback or ratings for leased assets.
- **Automation:** Implement automated lease end notifications via events or Oracles.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** Expand functionality to work across multiple blockchain networks.
